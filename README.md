# Skiable for Scriptable
![cover](https://github.com/p0fi/skiable-for-scriptable/blob/main/cover.png)

Note: This script requires at least [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app/) version 1.5.2!

## What's this?

This is the missing Widget of the bergfex Ski app! It parses the website content from https://www.bergfex.at/oesterreich/schneewerte/ to get the information to display on your homescreen. 

It shows you:
* Snow height on the summit
* Snow height in the valley
* Number of open lifts
* Date of the last data update

It currently supports 6 languages depending on which language your phone is set:
* English 🇬🇧
* German 🇩🇪
* French 🇫🇷
* Italian 🇮🇹
* Spanish 🇪🇸
* Slovenian 🇸🇮


## Instructions

1. Copy `skiable.js` into the Scriptable folder located in your iCloud Drive.
2. Launch Scriptable and make sure that `skiable` is listed in the scripts view.
3. Configure the ski resport you wish to display. The name of the resort must **exaclty** match the list on https://www.bergfex.at/oesterreich/schneewerte/
4. Run the script and verify that everything is working correctly.
5. Go back to your home screen and add a **small** Scriptable widget.
6. Edit the Scriptable widget and choose `skiable` as the script. 

## About this project

The script is authored by [@thartwi](https://twitter.com/thartwi) (me) because homescreen widgets are awesome and **winter is coming**! The bergfex Ski app does currently not offer a widget, so scriptable is here to save the day!
